	[1046066] = L"This spell is of the 4th circle and you should have little trouble with it.",

	[1046070] = L"Gate Travel is of the 7th circle however, and you will not be able to weave such intricate magic for a while.",
	[1046071] = L"Now - to get back to the subject at hand.  Whilst I was working in the caves, installing the teleporter, I marked a rune.",
	[1046072] = L"This would, in theory, allow us to travel into the cave to investigate the condition of our mining resources.",

Bury this virtue crystal at the spot and it will grow and amplify the node, which will cause additional nodes to be revealed (it will take one real day for a new node to be revealed).

While I've written a few interesting books on the marvelous Terathan race and their bizarre culture, now I've heard tales of a truly significant new discovery!<BR><BR>Apparently a race of ant-like creatures known as the Solen have appeared in our world, scuttling up from some previously hidden home. Can you believe it? Truly these are amazing times! To a scholar such as myself this is indeed an exciting opportunity.<BR><BR>That said, while I may be a genius of some reknown, sharp as a tack and quick with the quill, I'm afraid I'm not much of the adventuring type. Though I have gained assistance before, I still have many unanswered questions.<BR><BR>I am particularly interested in the Solen Egg Nests that are studiously protected by the Solen workers.

Don't make that face at me - this is how things work in a proper society, and ours has been more proper than most since the dawn of time. It's them or me, and whenever I give it any thought, I'm quite sure I'd prefer it to be them.<BR><BR>I also need you to gather some zoogi fungus for me - 50 should do the trick.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?",

The Ararat, while structurally intact is not fit for sailing.  Her hull has been breached and her sails torn.  Debris litters all decks.

	[1078006] = L"Greetings! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Samurai profession, seek out the following instructors:<br><br>Hamato teaches Bushido. I suggest talking to him first. Bushido is the way of life for a Samurai. A Samurai can honorably execute his enemies or even evade powerful attacks such as dragon's breath or lightning bolts.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will want to know how to handle a weapon. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<br><br>Andreas Vesalius teaches Anatomy. Knowledge of the flesh helps a Samurai in several ways. Knowing where to strike an opponent helps you maximize your damage, knowing where to apply a bandage helps you heal better and you can even size up your opponent's strength and dexterity.<br><br>Avicenna teaches Healing. As a Samurai, you're going to find yourself face to face with your foes, which means you will get hurt; sometimes badly. Knowing how to heal yourself and your allies is an invaluable skill for any Samurai.<br><br>Tyl Ariadne teaches Parrying. The more skilled you are at deflecting your opponent's blows, the longer you'll last in battle.<br><br>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon does not really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<br><br>Hamato is located at the School of Bushido. The other instructors are located at the Warrior Guild Hall.<br><br>Always remember...<br><br>A man who is a warrior by trade should calm his mind and look into the depths of others. Doing so is the way to becoming a legendary Samurai and the way to true Enlightenment.",

(Temporary \"followers,\" such as hirelings, escorts, and animated dead, will not be transferred.)<br>- Please verify the contents of your character's \"transfer crate\" are correct before initiating the transfer to the new shard.

Those who wish to begin a career in any of these arts, as well as prospectors who are willing to brave the danger-filled forests nearby, will find this town an excellent home. <br>Minoc is also interesting in its large population of gypsies and old-timers who have been mining since the town was a small hamlet. Because it is fairly distant from the rule of Lord British and has grown up quickly from very small beginnings to significant wealth, Minoc is a rough frontier town. Although guards keep the peace in the city streets, the surrounding countryside can be dangerous indeed. Travelers should beware of bandits, thieves, and prowling monsters.<br>Mount Kendall is one of Britannia's most famous mountains, known for its caves and rich ore veins.<br> For those seeking to learn a trade, Minoc offers guild halls for miners and warriors.<br><br> Amenities: Architect, Armorer, Bank, Blacksmith, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Provisioner, Stable, Tanner, Tavern, Tinker.

Equipment for riding, traveling on shipboard, and walking is available, and supplies for self-preservation in times of danger abound.<br><br> Because the inhabitants of Skara Brae are more inclined to intellectualism than other warriors, they embrace both magical and physical combat, and both are well represented here.<br><br> For those seeking adventure in the wilds, a short ferry ride leads to the extension of the town along the coast of Britannia, and from there it is a short trip into the forests and swamps of the southern mainland where monsters and more mundane creatures abound.<br><br> Amenities: Animal Supplies, Armorer, Bank, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Magic Shop, Provisioner, Reagent Shop, Shipwright, Stable, Tailor, Tavern, Weapons Shop",

To the north, from within the Tomb of Kings, the Arisen are emerging each night to attack the Holy City.<br><br>Shortly after we unsealed the entrance to the Abyss, found in the depths of the Tomb, strange happenings began to occur. At first, there were only a few reports of strange noises coming from the Tomb of Kings late at night. Investigating the Tomb during the daytime uncovered nothing unusual, so we sent someone to seek out the source of these noises one night. When morning came and he had not returned, we knew something was amiss.<br><br>We sent word to the Royal City asking for help, but the following night, unspeakable evil erupted from the entrance to the Tomb! A defense of the city was quickly marshaled, but the Arisen proved to be quite powerful. Unfortunately, they are also persistent, as every night since then, this city, the original birthplace of our people, has faced wave after wave of Arisen. We know not the cause of the attacks, nor the source, as investigations by daylight yield little. We have been hard pressed just to defend the Elders here, much less push the Arisen back into the Tomb.<br><br>We could use your help in this! Either help defend the Holy City at night, or enter the Tomb of Kings itself and seek out the Arisen at their source. It is your choice to make, as you know your own abilities best.

Obviously, knowing how to forge metal into weapons and armor is what defines a blacksmith. He can be found right next to me in this shop.<br><br>Amelia Youngstone teaches Tinkering. Tinkering complements the blacksmith skill as it allows you to craft your own blacksmithing tools, as well as other useful items. Amelia's workshop is Northwest of here in town.<br><br>Jacob Waltz teaches Mining. Without the knowledge of mining ore and smelting, a blacksmith will have to purchase ingots from the market. This greatly cuts into the profit making potential of Blacksmithing. You can find Jacob up in the hills to the South outside of town.<br><br>Kaelynna teaches Magery. This skill allows one to cast spells that can heal, transport, weaken, and even slay opponents with fireballs and lightning bolts. Magery spells can also summon elementals and powerful daemons to aid the caster in battle. The sheer versatility of the Magery skill makes it highly useful to any blacksmith. Kaelynna resides North of here in the New Haven Mage School.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. Knowing how to handle a weapon is very important if you want to protect yourself from brigands and monsters. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not. Jockles can be found in the Warrior's Guild Hall which is East of here.<br><br>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This skill complements Swordsmanship, as just knowing how to handle a weapon doesn't really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe. Alden can also be found in the Warrior's Guild Hall.<br><br>Good luck, and remember that a respected Blacksmith never tries to overcharge for services!",

Anyhow, back to what I was saying. I have nearly perfected a recipe for what I shall call the irresistibly tasty treat.

Protecting Ter Mur from the darkness, and its desire to consume the land completely, is a burden passed down from one ruler to another upon ascension to the throne.  During my rule, I have been more successful than my predecessors but, now, I fear that the greatest evil both myself and my people have ever faced is about to return.<br><br>\tLong ago, Ter Mur was assaulted by the most formidable and horrid servant of the Void it had ever faced. Called Scelestus the Defiler, this daemon proved invincible to any weapon or spell that was utilized against him. I was unable to defeat him and was forced to imprison him instead. Sadly, my own daughter was caught in the spell and stands imprisoned next to the daemon. It has been this way for a thousand years now.<br><br>\tI have received word that the isle which houses the daemon, Athenaeum Isle, is once again swarming with daemons. Based on the description provided to me, I believe these are the minions of the Defiler himself. They have no doubt crawled out of the dark in anticipation of their master\x2019s return. In truth, the prison I placed him within will not last forever.<br><br>\tI ask that you journey to the southwestern flight tower, adventurer, and head further southwest towards the shore. Near the water's edge, you will find an ancient teleport site which will transport you to the isle. Once there, please slay as many of these monsters as you can. Additionally, please keep your eye out for any documents that you may discover. This isle was the former home of our Great Library and, when it fell, not all of the documents and books were able to be taken to the new location here in the Royal City.<br><br>\tSlay the beasts and return to me any documents that you acquire.<br><br>\tBe careful, and go with honor.",

An old foe, the Lifestealer eats the hearts of its victims, consuming their essence in a similar fashion to how I consume their souls.

As I'm sure you know, Astaroth, the Shadowlord of Hatred, is compelled to oppose the Principle of Love and everything related to it. What you may not know is that Love and Hatred are entwined at a very basic level, and one cannot exist without the other to put it in perspective, nor can one become too influential without the other diminishing an equal amount.<br><br>From what I've read in this book, it's clear that by corrupting the shrines and extinguishing the Candle of Love, Astaroth is attempting to spread the influence of Hatred in the world. The more Hatred that exists, the less Love's presence is felt, and the more powerful Astaroth becomes! Obviously, we cannot let the balance swing too far in Astaroth's favor if we are to have any hope of thwarting his future plans.<br><br>The Candle of Love itself is kept in a cavern underneath the Abbey, far below where we're standing now. The entrance to the cavern can be found in the back room of the winery next door. However, the tunnel leading to the cavern is dark, and it seems that no normal light can pierce this unnatural darkness.<br><br>From what we\x2019ve been able to discern, in order to enter this impenetrable curtain of darkness that now enshrouds the cavern, many brave adventurers will need to purify the light from a regular candle and then touch the purified flame to the Candle of Love. However, it all starts with one person... you.<br><br>Quickly, go to each of the three shrines and help cleanse them. Then meditate on each virtue, and the way forward will be shown to you.

You wish to learn how to scribe spell scrolls? You have come to the right place! Inscribed in a steady hand and imbued with the power of reagents, a scroll can mean the difference between life and death in a perilous situation. Those knowledgeable in Inscription may transcribe spells to create useful and valuable magical scrolls.<BR><BR>Before you inscribe a spell, you must first be able to cast the spell without the aid of a scroll. This means that you need the appropriate level of proficiency as a mage, the required mana, and the required reagents. Second, you will need a blank scroll to write on and a scribe's pen. Then, you will need to decide which particular spell you wish to scribe. It may sound easy, but there is a bit more to it. As with the development of all skills, you need to practice Inscription of lower level spells before you can move onto the more difficult ones.<BR><BR>The most important aspect of Inscription is mana. Inscribing a scroll with a magic spell drains your mana. When inscribing 3rd circle or lower spells this will not be much of a problem for these spells consume a small amount of mana. However, when you are inscribing higher circle spells, you may see your mana drain rapidly. When this happens, pause or meditate before continuing.<BR><BR>I suggest you begin scribing any 3rd and 4th circle spells that you know. If you don't possess any, you can always barter with one of the local mage merchants or a fellow adventurer that is a seasoned Scribe.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scribe and I will reward you with an arcane prize.",

I can teach you how to 'Stop the World' around you and focus your inner energies on replenishing your mana. What is mana? Mana is the life force for everyone who practices arcane arts. When a practitioner of magic invokes a spell or scribes a scroll, it consumes mana. Having an abundant supply of mana is vital to excelling as a practitioner of the arcane. Those of us who study the art of Meditation are also known as stoics. The Meditation skill allows stoics to increase the rate at which they regenerate mana.<BR><BR>A stoic needs to perform abilities or cast spells to deplete mana before he can meditate to replenish it. Meditation can occur passively or actively. Actively Meditation is more difficult to master but allows for the stoic to replenish mana at a significantly faster rate. Metal armor interferes with the regenerative properties of Meditation. It is wise to wear leather or cloth protection when meditating.<BR><BR>Head East out of town and go to Old Haven.

But it was from afar that I admired her, for it is not for one so lowly as I to pay court to the likes of her. You have heard of the fair Thalia, Lady of Nujel'm? No? Well, she was my Muse, my inspiration, and when I heard she was to be married, I lost whatever pitiful talent I possessed. I felt I must compose a portrait of her, my masterpiece, or I would never be able to paint again. You, my friend, have helped me complete my work. Now I ask another favor of you.

As a center for trade, the city has attracted craftsmen and adventurers of every kind, and guilds for mages, miners, warriors, and fishermen can be found here.<br><br> For those inclined to dally, the museum of Vesper is an interesting side-trip for visitors to the city.<br><br> Adventure-seekers can find plenty of danger to the northeast, where dark forests hold dangerous monsters.

Guilds for both warriors and armorers are to be found on the main island.<br><br>  As an island city, Jhelom is not particularly dangerous for starting adventurers, but a moongate on the central island offers daring adventurers a chance to enter the wilderness in search of danger and reward.

This place is a center for learning and self-reflection that draws travelers from the world over.<br>Because of their eternal quest to find justice and equality, the druids have also been given the responsibility for administering justice. The great courtroom on the far western edge of the city's boundaries has often been the site of momentous trials, and the prison beyond has been the home for many dangerous criminals.<br>In the heart of Yew, a magical portal has been opened that allows access to the great elven home, The Heartwood. The druids of Yew and the elves of the Heartwood have been exchanging good will through ambassadors, though there have been claims of hostile factions on both sides.<br> For those interested more in adventure than in history or peace, the wilderness around Yew is wild, indeed.
